1. module declaration
   - Name of module
   - Ports : Direction, size, name, (reg kind of ports)

2. Local variable declaration
   - awlen_t
   - awaddr_t
   - awsize_t
   - awburst_t
   - awprot_t
   - awcache_t
   - awid_t
   - byte mem[int]; //asscoaitve array

3. FUnctionality
 i. Handling write address phase
    - Who does this phase?  Master
    - what slave supposed to do?
         o Wait for awvalid == 1
         o store the write address channel information(awaddr, awlen...) to local variables
         o Give acknoledgement(awready) to the BFM(master)
         o Write address phase will be done
 ii. Handling write data phase
    - Who does this phase?  Master
    - what slave supposed to do?
         o Wait for wvalid == 1
         o store the write data to Memory declared above
         o Give acknoledgement(wready) to the BFM(master)
         o Write data one transfer phase will be done
 iii. Handling write resp phase
    - Who does this phase?  Slave
    - what slave supposed to do?
         o when it is supposed to do? When write data transfers complete(wlast will tell this)
         o Drive bresp, bid, bvalid = 1
         o wait for bready == 1
         o indicates completion of write resp phase, hence write transaction
 iv. Handling read address phase
 v. Handling read data phase
